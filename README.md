# X-Ray Predictive Analytics for Pneumonia Diagnosis Utilizing AI and Big Data  

## Overview  
This project leverages deep learning and big data analytics to diagnose pneumonia from X-ray images. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and TensorFlow, the model aims to assist medical professionals in accurate and efficient pneumonia detection.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of chest X-ray images, labeled as **pneumonia** or **normal**. The data is preprocessed using image augmentation techniques to improve model performance.  

## Methodology  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation  
- **Model Architecture:** CNN-based deep learning model  
- **Training:** Optimized using Adam optimizer with cross-entropy loss  
- **Evaluation:** Performance measured via accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

## Installation  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```bash
